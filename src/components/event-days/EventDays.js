                                impediment to Africa achieving its full economic
                                growth potential. Meeting the demand for key
                                infrastructure has been identified as a priority
                                in Africa, which remains one of the world's
                                fastest growing economic hubs. There is still
                                interesting potential for increasing investments
                                to scaleup industrial productivity, particularly
                                in the food, energy and transportation sectors.
                                Addressing Africa's trade and infrastructural
                                capacity deficits is essential for the continent
                                to achieve prosperity, sustainable economic
                                growth, inequality reduction, increased trade
                                facilitation, and doubling the continent's share
                                of global exports. Currently, the transportation

                                Leveraging intra-Africa trade requires

                                The state-to-state nature of the Dispute
                                Settlement Mechanism of AfCFTA could be a
                                potential barrier to ensuring effective dispute
                                resolution under the Agreement. African States,
                                if not completely, almost never litigate against
                                each other over trade related matters and it is
                                uncertain if they would do so in the case of the
                                AfCFTA. The low participation of African States
                                in trade dispute resolution at WTO and within
                                African Regional Economic Communities is a
                                glaring indication that they do not possess the
                                political will to resolve trade issues.
                                Relatively, the question of who can initiate
                                legal proceedings is crucial to the evaluation
                                of the AfCFTA legal framework. However, it is
                                important that the AfCFTA program provides an
                                efficient dispute settlement option for the
                                private sector who are key players in the AfCFTA
                                ecosystem. Hence, addressing critical legal and
                                institutional constraints is of utmost priority
                                now than ever.

                                Enshrined in article 4(2)(i) is a focus on the
                                freer and less restrictive movement of people,
                                rights of residence, and rights of establishment
                                by Africans across the borders of AU member
                                states. The justification is that colonial
                                powers' decisions on borders resulted in poorly
                                defined territories that paid little attention
                                to cultural or economic assimilations among
                                Africans. Ultimately, as demonstrated by the EU,
                                opening borders to allow for greater free
                                movement of factors of production, including
                                people, contributed to economic development and
                                more peaceful relationships in the region. The
                                evidence that free movement of people across
                                borders promotes economic development remains
                                compelling. In recent decades, progress toward
                                greater freedom of movement for Africans has
                                been uneven and slow. Can Africa accelerate
                                initiatives that allow Africans to move freely
                                within the continent? What strategies should be
                                implemented through the AfCFTA program to
                                actively manage the freer movement of people in
                                order to achieve socioeconomic transformation?

                                Within the African continent, there is a growing
                                interest in the relationships that links trade
                                and security in African borderlands. On the
                                continent today, terrorism and corruption
                                continue slowed the growth of cross-border
                                trade. Further, evidence from the Horn, North,
                                and West African regions suggests that African
                                countries face the difficult task of pursuing
                                regional integration efforts while lacking the
                                resources or willingness to control their
                                borders. In other words, the process of regional
                                economic integration is rarely accompanied by
                                effective border securitization. How can a
                                coordinated political approach advance
                                cross-border security in order to accelerate
                                intra-African trade?

                                The African Diaspora is recognized as an
                                important source of economic and financial
                                contributions by the African Union, particularly
                                in terms of remittances. The World Bank
                                estimates that the African diaspora saves around
                                $53 billion a year, which can be used as a
                                source of investment in African economies.
                                However, the potential for the African Diaspora
                                extends far beyond remittances and includes the
                                transfer of human capital, knowledge, technology
                                and direct investments. Diaspora investment can
                                complement and supplement traditional FDI,
                                providing a more stable and sustainable source
                                of funding for economic development and growth.
                                Diaspora investment tends to be more patient and
                                risk-tolerant than traditional FDI and is often
                                directed towards sectors that may be considered
                                less attractive to traditional investors. Given
                                the potential for AfCFTA to drive wealth on the
                                continent, it is crucial that the diaspora is
                                welcomed as a growth partner, exploring the
                                potential of diaspora and foreign direct
                                investment in driving economic growth and
                                development in Africa.
