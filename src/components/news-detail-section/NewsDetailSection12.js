              The Africa Prosperity Network wishes to inform all partners and
              the general public that Heads of state of the Africa Union (AU)
              have unanimously adopted the Action Compact of the maiden edition
              of the Africa Prosperity Dialogues (APD), which took place from
              the 26th to the 28th of January 2023 in Ghana. <br />
              The theme of the APD was "The Africa Continental Free Trade Area
              (AfCFTA): From Ambition to Action, Delivering Prosperity through
              Continental Trade", and that of the 36th AU summit was "The Year
              of AfCFTA: Acceleration of the African Continental Free Trade Area
              Implementation". This alignment of themes made the decision of the
              AU to unanimously adopt the action compact a strategic one. <br />
              Organizers of the Africa Prosperity Dialogues (APD) ahead of the
              formal adoption by the AU, presented the Action Compact to heads
              of state and governments who were in attendance at the 36th
              Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union in Addis

            <p>
              The adoption of the APD action compact by the AU followed a call
              by President Akufo-Addo, for the African Union Commission
              chairperson to officially admitted the Action Compact of the APD
              into the records of the 36th AU Summit when he addressed the
              plenary on Sunday (19 February). <br />
              In his remarks, President Akufo-Addo indicated that Ghana,
              recognising the need for the acceleration of AfCFTA, partnered
              with the AfCFTA Secretariat to convene the Africa Prosperity
              Dialogues.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Dialogues, according to President Akufo-Addo, "going forward,
              will provide a deliberate annual platform for Africa's political,
              business and thought leaders to meet, think, plan and work
              together on a shared commitment to delivering with urgency the
              AfCFTA goal of building the world's largest single market".
              President Akufo-Addo also underlined Ghana’s commitment to
              expediting AfCFTA's implementation because the "AfCFTA Agreement
              stands to contribute significantly to sustainable economic growth,
              employment generation, the inflow of foreign direct investment and
              industrial development. He stressed that by deepening economic
              integration in Africa, prosperity will spread wider and faster
              among Africans across Africa. "

            <h3 className="news-caption">Memorandum of Understanding</h3>
            <p>
              As part of engagements between the Executive Secretary of APN,
              Hannah Awuku, and officials of the African Union after the
              adoption of the action compact, it was proposed that the APN and
              the African Union, as well as the Africa Continental Free Trade
              Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat, ought to sign a Memorandum of
              Understanding (MoU) to pave the way for their future engagements.
            </p>
            <p>
              "The APN, subject to the approval of its Board of Directors, will
              commence the necessary processes to ensure that the suggestion to
              sign an MoU is made within the shortest possible time," Miss
              Hannah Awuku stated the Africa Prosperity Network participation in
              the 36th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and
              Governments of the African Union has been an eye-opener. I am
              convinced that our engagements will help shape the future of the
              Africa Prosperity Dialogues, " she added.
            </p>
            <h3 className="news-caption">The Dialogues</h3>
            <p>
              The Africa Prosperity Dialogues were in two parts: first, business
              executives, policy leaders, business associations, ministers of
              state, heads of regional economic communities, senior officials
              from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat,
              senior officials of the African Union Commission, United Nations
              Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), United Nations Development
              Programme (UNDP), technocrats, women and young entrepreneurs, and
              other thought leaders held a retreat at Safari Valley Resort, from
              26-27 January 2023. <br />
              Attendees of the retreat concluded that the full implementation of
              the AfCFTA Agreement would attract cross-border investments by
              eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers and enable investors in
              member countries to have access to a continent of 1.3 billion
              people with a combined GDP of US$3.4 trillion – a figure expected
              to grow exponentially in the years ahead. <br />
              The retreat also emphasized the centrality of the private sector
              in achieving the AfCFTA goals and urged African countries to
              undertake initiatives in support of their private sector’s access
              to the preferential treatment provided by the Agreement
            </p>
            <p>
              Topics such as Ratification, Market Access, Trade Liberalisation
              and Dispute Resolution, Trade in Services, Negotiations on Phase
              II of the AfCFTA Agreement, Guided Trade Initiative,
              Industrialization, Innovation and Technology, Financing and
              Resource Mobilization, Free Movement of Persons, and Partnerships
              for Impact, were all up for discussion during two-days of
              dialogue.
            </p>
            <h3 className="news-caption">Presidential and Business Dialogue</h3>
            <p>
              The second part was the Presidential and Business Executives'
              Dialogue held at Peduase Lodge, Ghana’s Presidential Retreat

              Identifiable groups such as the business community, governments,
              the AfCFTA Secretariat, and development partners called for
              investment in science technology and innovation to power
              value-added made-in-Africa production and industrialization,
              pursue commodity-based industrialization, facilitate the
              production of high-quality goods and services within the African
