              Africa’s integration is no longer a matter of choice. Against an
              international backdrop of changing political and economic
              priorities, Africa must plot a new course for its
              industrialisation and economic development, using the momentum of
              regional integration.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Africa, a vast continent of over 1.2 billion people,
              integration has considerable potential not only for promoting
              robust and equitable economic growth through markets, but also for
              reducing conflict and enhancing trade liberalisation.

              Development economists, policymakers, African and non-African
              researchers are meeting in Kigali, Rwanda this week to discuss the
              shape and future of continental integration at the 13th African
              Economic Conference (AEC). Convened on the theme, “Regional and
              Continental Integration for Africa’s Development”, the three-day
              event will explore proposals for enhancing the broad and inclusive
              integration of African economies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The build-up to the conference began in March 2018, when 44
              African countries committed to the launch of a common market for
              Africa - the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). This
              followed the launch of an African Common Passport in July 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
              The African Continental Free Trade Agreement seeks to bring Africa
              into the global trade environment as one continent rather than as
              individual countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recent research by the African Development Bank shows that
              intra-African trade is the lowest of all global regions at
              approximately 15%, compared to 54% in the North American Free
              Trade Area, 70% within the European Union and 60% in Asia.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Organization of African Unity and its successor, the African
              Union, have championed continental cooperation since the 1960s,
              culminating in the signing of the Abuja Treaty in 1991. This was
              the genesis of Africa’s regional economic communities (RECs),
              regarded as the building blocks of the African Economic Community.
            </p>
            <p>
              To date, the RECs have made slow but steady progress on Africa’s
              integration, particularly in infrastructure (SADC, EAC), trade
              liberalisation and facilitation (West Africa economic and monetary
              Union, COMESA), free movement of people (ECOWAS), and peace and
              security (ECOWAS and SADC).
            </p>
            <p>
              To build on these accomplishments, this year’s African Economic
              Conference (AEC) in Kigali must define what the African
              Continental Free Trade Agreement means for Africa, and how it will
              foster integration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AfCFTA agreement brings together the largest number of
              countries within a free trade area in the world. 44 countries
              signed the pact in March. The number has since risen to 49. It
              proposes to create a single market for goods and services, with
              free movement of people and investments across 55 countries. This
              will redefine trade relations among African states. It also
              promises to promote trade liberalisation and improve interactions
              within the existing regional economic communities. A dispute
              settlement mechanism, similar to that set up by the World Trade
              Organization is embedded in the agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              In September 2018, the Geneva-based International Trade Centre
              (ITC) published a private sector guide to the AfCFTA. Beyond
              lifting people out of poverty and invigorating Africa’s growth
              trajectory, the ITC observes that the African private sector will
              be the key beneficiary.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Potential advantages to the private sector include increasing
              economies of scale and access to cheaper raw materials and
              intermediate inputs; better conditions for regional value chains
              and integration into global value chains,” the ITC says.
            </p>
            <p>
              To accelerate the integration, the priority of economic
              integration must be balanced by those of social, cultural and
              political integration. Policy instruments, especially for
              overlapping REC member nations, need to be harmonised. Currently,
              weak enforcement of existing treaties and non-tariff barriers
              continue to hinder free movement of goods, services and persons
              across borders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The preponderance of bilateral and multilateral agreements between
              African states and the international community should also be
              reviewed to ensure that existing and future trade and investment
              arrangements align with regional and continental integration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another key concern is that integration must be people-centred,
              with stronger citizens’ partnerships, especially among Africa’s
              burgeoning youth population, private sector players and civil
              society institutions, in order to ensure sustainable development.
