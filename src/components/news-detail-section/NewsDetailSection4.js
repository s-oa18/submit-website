              The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Council of
              Ministers Responsible for Trade has approved trading under the
              AfCFTA to progress on the basis of the already agreed-upon Rules
              of Origin (RoO) covering 87.7% of total tariff lines.

              This resolution was taken by the Eighth (8th) Meeting of the
              AfCFTA Council of Ministers held January 28-29, in Accra, Ghana.
              RoO is the criteria for determining the country source of a
              product hence an AfCFTA Certificate of Origin is necessary to
              confirm if a particular product complies with the agreed RoO
              criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              The agreed-on tariff lines will be endorsed by the forthcoming
              35th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and
              Government of the African Union, to be held February 5 – 6.
              Afterwards, the AfCFTA Secretariat will publish an AfCFTA Tariff
              Book, detailing RoO and customs procedures applying to specific
              products. Accordingly, the tariff book will enable traders under
              the free trade area to identify their specific products, know what
              RoO applies to each product as well as associated tariffs.

              The Council of Ministers requested that necessary steps be
              undertaken to gazette the schedules of tariff concessions, in
              accordance with the applicable national legislations of AfCFTA
              State Parties. It noted that negotiations on trade in services had
              reached an advanced stage of conclusion with 46 AU member states
              having submitted their schedules of specific commitments and
              accordingly, resolved that the negotiations be concluded by June
              30, 2022.
            </p>

              The Council applauded the republics of Burundi, Seychelles as well
              as the United Republic of Tanzania for having recently deposited
              their instruments of ratification and thus increased the number of
              AfCFTA State Parties to forty (40). The Council also applauded the
              Republic of Gabon for successfully hosting the AfCFTA Forum on
              Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the Council applauded the operationalization of the
              Pan-African Payments and Settlements System (PAPSS) held January
              13 and acknowledged the deployment of a facility worth $1billion
              by the Africa Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) for the development
              of the automotive value chain to aid Africa’s industrialization.
              Similarly, the $1 billion-worth AfCFTA Adjustment Fund, which
              seeks to help countries adjust to tariff revenue losses resulting
              from AfCFTA’s implementation, will be operationalized by
              Afreximbank in February
