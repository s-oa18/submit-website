              THE African Association of Automotive Manufacturers, AAAM, and the
              African Continental Free Trade Area, AfCFTA, Secretariat are
              hosting a webinar to explore how the AfCFTA is helping to shape
              the automotive policies for Africa which, in turn, drives
              industrialisation. Also to be discussed during the free virtual
              event is why the Rules of Origin are key in driving investment and
              confidence in Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We believe that all automotive industry role players, including
              policy advisors, business leaders and potential investors will
              gain great insight from the event as we unpack various aspects of
              the potential of the African market and the opportunities it
              provides.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We applaud the African Union for launching the AfCFTA; this is
              the largest free trade bloc in terms of participating countries
              and will provide the scale that is required for a globally
              competitive African automotive sector,” says David Coffey, the CEO
              of AAAM.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The political will is required to put significant policy reforms
              and trade facilitation measures in place to realise the benefit of
              the AfCFTA” The Pan African Auto Pact Vision and how this can fast
              track the development of the automotive sector in the context of
              the AfCFTA will be examined during the event. This will include
              insight into activities taking place on the continent to
              industrialise and grow the automotive sector and why a Pact can be
              a short-term reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of particular interest will be a discussion on the fast-tracking
              of the conclusion of the automotive Rules of Origin.
            </p>
            <p>
              In simplistic terms, the Rules of Origin are a passport that
              ultimately enables goods to circulate – free of duty – within a
              free trade area (FTA) such as the AfCFTA, as long as these goods
              qualify as originating within the FTA. The Rules define the
              criteria that must be met for a product to be considered as having
              its origin within the FTA.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019 intra-African trade was a mere 15%, compared to around 47%
              in America, 61% in Asia and 67% in Europe, but that could change
              radically now that the AfCFTA is up and running. Once the
              agreement is fully implemented and the Rules of Origin finalised,
              the gross domestic product of most African countries could
              increase by 1% to 3% once all tariffs are eliminated.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The finalisation of the AfCFTA agreement and the Rules of Origin
              with respect to automotive are vital to the realisation of the
              AAAM’s vision of building a successful automotive ecosystem that
              will lead to a sustainable industry of scale that creates
              significant jobs, while assisting in the industrialisation of the
              automotive sector in Africa,” explains Mike Whitfield, who is
              President of the AAAM and Managing Director of Nissan Africa, and
              is one of the confirmed speakers for the webinar.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whitfield and Coffey will be joined by a panel of experts that
              include His Excellency Wamkele Mene (Secretary-General, AfCFTA
              Secretariat), Prof. Benedict Oramah (President Afreximbank), Dr.
              Markus Thill (Vice President of the AAAM and President – Region
              Africa of Robert Bosch), and Alec Erwin (AAAM policy expert).
