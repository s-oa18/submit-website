              <strong>COMMENT | Célestin Monga |</strong> When Kwame Nkrumah,
              under whose leadership Ghana became the first African country to
              claim independence in 1957, was overthrown by a military coup in
              1966, few of his fellow citizens shed a tear for his regime. But
              one aspect of his legacy remains relevant to this day and merits
              careful consideration.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nkrumah was a visionary and charismatic leader whose focus was on
              modernising Ghana and on campaigning for Africa’s political unity.
              His most brilliant idea was to integrate the continent and create
              the United States of Africa. But he favoured the development of
              costly, capital-intensive projects, which led to unsustainable
              foreign debt and deficits while creating few employment
              opportunities. Economic contraction led to widespread unrest and
              to a loss of credibility for the idea of African integration, and
              to fallout with his famous economic adviser, the future Nobel
              laureate W. Arthur Lewis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nkrumah’s intuition about the potential benefits of Africa’s
              integration was based on a sound economic rationale, which he
              failed to articulate convincingly. With 16 landlocked countries,
              Africa is more fragmented than any other continent. The small size
              of many countries and the resulting fragmentation of domestic
              markets result in various diseconomies of scale, impeding economic
              development. In 2017, more than three-quarters of African
              countries had fewer than 30 million people, and about half had a
              GDP of less than $10 billion.
            </p>

            <p>
              After Nkrumah’s fall from power, other African leaders took up his
              goal of building the United States of Africa, based on the
              Organisation of African Unity. The OAU subsequently adopted a
              series of treaties to make economic integration a reality. The
              African Economic Community was created in 1991, and, after the OAU
              was disbanded in 2002, leaders adopted the African Union Agenda
              2063 in 2015. The continent’s leaders also created a large number
              of regional institutions to make incremental progress toward
              Nkrumah’s goal. Unfortunately, overlapping and often contradictory
              regional economic communities have constituted a mostly
              ineffective “Spaghetti bowl” of institutions with little authority
              and weak analytical capacity. This has made African integration
              sound like an empty political promise used by leaders who have
              little will to make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, researchers have cast doubt on the goal of integration.
              All African economies combined still represent only about 3% of
              global GDP, and purchasing power remains low. Why, then, devote
              limited financial resources to building costly infrastructure
              aimed at integrating the continent? While creating a single
              African market is a desirable goal, pursuing it must not distract
              national policymakers’ attention from the huge potential gains to
              be had from integration into the global economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              A new study from the African Development Bank provides evidence
              that both objectives are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they
              could be mutually reinforcing. The report also examines the
              potential gains from regional public goods, such as synchronising
              financial governance frameworks, pooling power, opening skies to
              competition, and opening borders to free movement of people,
              goods, and services.
            </p>
            <p>
              The study shows that a borderless continent that enables
              agricultural and industrial production across national boundaries
              is the foundation of a globally competitive African market,
              because it would offer economies of scale to investors, while
              creating much bigger markets and providing new opportunities for
              small firms and large. It would also help eliminate monopoly
              positions and enhance cross-border spillovers between coastal and
              landlocked countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, integration can improve regional security, because the
              expansion of international trade often correlates with a reduction
              of conflict. Deeper market integration for goods, infrastructure
              services, and key factors of production (labour and capital) is
              especially important – both economically and strategically – for
              Africa’s small and fragmented economies.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a world where 60% of trade occurs through global value chains,
              Africa must industrialise to diversify away from natural resources
              and create jobs for its fast-growing young population. By boosting
              intra-continental trade, consumption, and investment, regional
              integration can be a strong vector for improving productivity,
              building manufacturing powerhouses, and developing credible
              African brands. Open regionalism could also stimulate connections
              between small and medium-size enterprises and international value
              chains, thereby enabling these firms to enter global markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, five trade measures could bring total gains worth
              4.5% of Africa’s GDP, or $134 billion a year – almost the amount
              of all official development aid in 2017. The first is elimination
              of all bilateral tariffs. Second, country-of-origin rules (needed
              to determine the source of a product) should be kept simple,
              flexible, and transparent. Third, all nontariff barriers on trade
              of goods and services should be removed on a most-favored-nation
              basis. Fourth, the World Trade Organisation’s Trade Facilitation
              Agreement should be implemented to reduce the time it takes to
              cross borders and the transaction costs associated with nontariff
              measures. Lastly, tariffs and nontariff barriers applied to trade
              with other developing countries should be reduced by half on a
              most-favored-nation basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The economic rationale for Nkrumah’s dream was stronger than
              previously thought. The adoption of the African Continental Free
              Trade Area by African leaders in 2018 is giving it new momentum.
              With the right balance of audacity and pragmatism, regional
              integration could yield large dividends for Africa and the world
              alike.
