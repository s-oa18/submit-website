            In an attempt to present the continent's strategic framework that aims to deliver the goal of inclusive and sustainable development, the Agenda 2063 was born. Agenda 2063 is Africa's blueprint and master plan for transforming the continent into a future global powerhouse. It is the continent's strategic framework that aims to deliver on its goal of inclusive and sustainable development. It is a tangible manifestation of the pan-African drive for unity, self-determination, freedom, progress, and collective prosperity pursued by Pan-Africanism and the African Renaissance. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Agenda 2063 emerged from African leaders' recognition of the need to refocus and reprioritize Africa's agenda away from the struggle against apartheid and the attainment of political independence for the continent, which had been the focus of The Organization of African Unity (OAU), the precursor to the African Union. This initiative prioritises inclusive social and economic development, continental and regional integration, democratic governance and peace and security amongst other issues aimed at repositioning Africa to becoming a dominant player in the global arena

            As an affirmation of their commitment to support Africa’s new path for attaining inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development African heads of state and government signed the 50th Anniversary Solemn Declaration during the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the formation of the OAU /AU in May 2013. The declaration marked the re-dedication of Africa towards the attainment of the Pan African Vision of An integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens, representing a dynamic force in the international arena and Agenda 2063 is the concrete manifestation of how the continent intends to achieve this vision within a 50 year period from 2013 to 2063. The Africa of the future was captured in a letter presented by the former Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Dr. Nkosazana Dlaminin Zuma.

            The need to envision a long-term 50 year development trajectory for Africa is important as Africa needs to revise and adapt its development agenda due to ongoing structural transformations; increased peace and reduction in the number of conflicts; renewed economic growth and social progress; the need for people centered development, gender equality and youth empowerment; changing global contexts such as increased globalization and the ICT revolution; the increased unity of Africa which makes it a global power to be reckoned with and capable of rallying support around its own common agenda; and emerging development and investment opportunities in areas such as agri-business, infrastructure development, health and education as well as the value addition in African commodities

            Agenda 2063 encapsulates not only Africa’s Aspirations for the Future but also identifies key Flagship Programmes which can boost Africa’s economic growth and development and lead to the rapid transformation of the continent.

            <p>
            Agenda 2063 also identifies key activities to be undertaken in its 10-year Implementation Plans which will ensure that Agenda 2063 delivers both quantitative and qualitative Transformational Outcomes for Africa and its citizen
