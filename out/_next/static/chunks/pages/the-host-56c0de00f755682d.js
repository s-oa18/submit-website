The secretariat will foster partnerships with credible institutions and governments to convene political, business and social sector leaders including associations each year to lead a continental action for prosperity through dialogues. The Africa Prosperity Dialogues, APN’s flagship event, will be an annual platform for this network of political, business and social sector leaders to deliberate on a sustainable way to implement the AU's Agenda 2063 for building the Africa we want, in a way that provides for quick wins for the people of Africa."],d=["The object and purpose of APN are to create an enabling platform for collaboration between political and business leaders of Africa to drive the collective prosperity of Africa and people of African descent."],h=["The services APN provides include: Convene Africa’s leaders in politics and business to discuss the prosperity of the continent, Establish a media network to push the single African market agenda,  Establish a network of Influential Africans to drive an African Prosperity Agenda.
